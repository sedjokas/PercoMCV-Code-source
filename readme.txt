To run this code, Networkx package is required
In oder to bypass some isues that may be related to the hadware, we recommand to install Anaconda
which comes up with some interested package already intalled such as networkx
Purposely for illustration we consider the graph Graphe. However, Graphe can be of any format supported by Networkx

Note: The code for the implementation of the first step is a short form of the k_clique_communities from Conrad Lee and Aric Hagberg
